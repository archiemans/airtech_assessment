﻿I assumeI have donea bit more work than was required by the assessment.
Just to make it looks and feels a bit more fun. 


Scenario
Transport.ly is a brand-new company that aims to provide efficient and fast air freight services; they currently have 3
planes the planes are scheduled to fly daily at noon. For this exercise, there are only 2 days of flights scheduled.
Day 1:
Flight 1: Montreal airport (YUL) to Toronto (YYZ)
Flight 2: Montreal (YUL) to Calgary (YYC)
Flight 3: Montreal (YUL) to Vancouver (YVR)
Day 2:
Flight 4: Montreal airport (YUL) to Toronto (YYZ)
Flight 5: Montreal (YUL) to Calgary (YYC)
Flight 6: Montreal (YUL) to Vancouver (YVR)
With each flight returning to the YUL at midnight.
Each plane has a capacity of 20 boxes each.
The company’s sales department has been able to sell 99 orders that are sending boxes to Toronto, Calgary, and
Vancouver, these orders are found in the attached json file. Each box represents 1 order.
As a member of the software engineering department you are asked to develop an application that can automate the
process of determining which boxes to load on each flight.Assumption 1: that schedule already loaded into system. No need to implement interactive modification of schedule at this stage)Assumption 2: that inventory of the company is also pre loaded into systemPlanes: 3Days: 2Planes departure at noon (does not have value for User stories below right now)Planes comming back to YUL at midnight. We do not plan any shippments for midnight flights (does not have value for user stories below right now)Plane capacity: 20 boxes per planeOrders Total: 99Each Order fits in 1 box------------------------99 orders => 99 boxesTurned out that 3 orders are missing from original file. only 96 ordersProblem: automatically distribute order/boxes on planes:	have to filter by destination, 	have to obey the priority of orders, 	have to mark dispatched orders to keep track of what was served and what was notRemark: The order file in json file is not in optimal form: property name is order name and the value is a single property presented as a property.Proposal: If it is our format make it more easy digestable and have structure like an array of order objects with properties order name and destination.USER STORY #1
As an inventory management user, I can load a flight schedule similar to the one listed in the Scenario above. For this
story you do not yet need to load the orders. I can also list out the loaded flight schedule on the console.
Expected output:
Flight: 1, departure: YUL, arrival: YYZ, day: 1
...
Flight: 6, departure: <departure_city>, arrival: <arrival_city>, day: x


USER STORY #2
As an inventory management user, I can generate flight itineraries by scheduling a batch of orders. These flights can be
used to determine shipping capacity.
Use the json file attached to load the given orders.
The orders listed in the json file are listed in priority order ie. 1..N

Expected output:
order: order-001, flightNumber: 1, departure: <departure_city>, arrival: <arrival_city>, day: x
...
order: order-099, flightNumber: 1, departure: <departure_city>, arrival: <arrival_city>, day: x
if an order has not yet been scheduled, output:
order: order-X, flightNumber: not scheduled
